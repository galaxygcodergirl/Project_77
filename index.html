    The console screen is all about writing something, you can use it to show square roots, your full name in concat, adding and subtracting numbers. To open console you right-click on the page and there will be a dropdown. Select inspect and the click on console on your new screen. To write anything on the console screen you can go to script.js if you have alot of code to do. But, if you have very less code open up the tag script and start writing your code down below.
